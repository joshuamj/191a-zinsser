# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Joshua Jackson

On Writing Well emphasized the importance of keeping things as simple as possible. It talks of simplicity and clutter 
in sentence construction and ways to both recognize and eliminate them in writing. Clutter seeks to disguise intent with 
superfluous words and phrases where the simplest of words could easily be used in its place; often with greater value. 
Every sentence and every word has a specific meaning, if it restates something or does not strengthen the point the 
writer is trying to make then it should be edited out of the writing.
